# Building a Virtual Machine for Programming Language

It's the implementation code of the amazing [Udemy's](https://www.udemy.com/) course called
[Building a Virtual Machine for Programming Language](https://www.udemy.com/course/virtual-machine/).
During the course, the author [Dmitry Soshnikov](https://www.udemy.com/user/dmitry-soshnikov/)
focuses specifically on _runtime semantics_, and builds a _stack-based VM_ for a programming language
very similar to _JavaScript_ or _Python_. Working closely with the _bytecode level_ allowing the student
to understand how _lower-level interpretation_ works in production _VMs_ today.
